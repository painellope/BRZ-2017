## Endian and Byte Order
There are two sets of terminology when it comes to reading a CAN frame. "Byte Order" and "Endian".

From what I understand, these are the same thing.

Endian comes in two flavours, Big Endian and little Endian.
Byte Order also comes in two, Motorola and Intel.

### To make this quick and easy

Motorola = Big Endian

Intel = little Endian
